	and so exception in removeItem method which checks for null item will never 
	be thrown when a null item is encountered
	Fix: moved null item exception condition to makePurchase method

(2)	Bug: inserting money in less than 1 cent increments or creating item with

	Fix: Put an insufficient funds exception in makePurchase method

(5)	Bug: Unnecessary "VendingMachine" in call to invalid code exception
	Fix: Deleted "VendingMachine
